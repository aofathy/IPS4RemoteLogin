# IPS4 Remote Login
If you need let users login to IPS4 from another domain you can use this script
I highly recommend you to use [SSO](https://community.invisionpower.com/4docs/advanced-usage/development/single-sign-on-sso-r98/) or [Custom Login Handler](https://community.invisionpower.com/4docs/advanced-usage/development/custom-login-handlers-r97/)
